//wanted to use const here, but apparently Rust inlines those to make them constructed per each
//use. Here I wanted an immutable reference to a static memory bit.
//ok, what I said above is very shallow. Actually
//const:
//
//    Have no fixed address in memory
//    Theyâ€™re inlined to each place which uses them, this means they are put directly into the binary on the places which use them.
//    Usually faster runtime but bigger executable file because it doesn't have to look up an address like static
//
//static:
//
//    Have a fixed address in memory
//    Their value is loaded from this fixed address each place which uses them.
//    Usually slower runtime because we need to perform the extra instruction of loading the data from the fixed address.
//    However this could result in a smaller executable file (only when it is used frequently) because
//    it doesn't have to have multiple copies of the value baked into the executable.
//
//The data below will not be used frequently in the code I think.

//OK, it turns out static and const fields are very limited and cannot, for example use Vecs.
//Shame.
